    <div id="header"> <h2> What was your first job in Columbia? How much did it pay? </h2>
    <p> The Missourian asked people those questions on Facebook, and the responses brought back all sorts of memories. For some, the minimum wage for that time period doesn't align with what people remember making. Memories can get fuzzy after decades of work. <p></div>

        "Ben Franklin Deptment store in Parkade Plaza 1967 $1.00 per hour. On paydays after getting off work I would stop across the street at Mugs-Up and buy a gallon of Root Beer. When I got home with my Mom and Dad would make all of us a Root Beer Float."

        "Route carrier for the Columbia Daily Tribune at 12 years old. Walked the route under the post man's crede and had to spend 4 or more evenings a month collecting the monthly subscription from each customer. We had to buy the rubber bands and our canvas delivery pack. We were required to place the paper on the porch. No plastic film sleeves back then so rain and snow posed a real problem. Carriers were independent contractors and we purchased and then paid for the papers. Can't remember what I made each month .. but as a 12 year old, I thought I was rich. Bought a stereo with an 8-track tape player after saving for a few months."

       "My Dad dropped me off at DQ across from DHHS and said "I got you a job here" my father wanted me to learn the biz as he had owned KuKu Burgers, Dynomite, Jacks Goumet and 2100 West. This was in 1975. You could work legally at 15. I was paid $2.01 per hour and that was not a server wage then. That didn't change for maybe thirty years. My brother Ralph Pfremmer followed the path also."

       "My very first was at the very first pizza parlor in Columbia. The name was TONY's. It was located on Broadway where Tropical [Liqueurs] is located today. I was Tonys first waitress: sixteen years old and scared to death. I made 65 cents per hour. Tony taught me how to hand toss the dough. Took a long time before it didn't fall on my arm there were no dough pressures back then.
        </p>
        <p>The first pizza I served I was walking to the booth a couple I knew was looking a me when all of a sudden I dropped the  pizza upside down on the floor. I picked it up an went to Tony. He made them another one at no charge. I went to throw the pizza out but Tony grab it and served it to the next one ordering one like it."</p>

       "In the spring of 1965, I hand-carried Sherwin-Williams' circulars house to house and made $100 for two days' work. I spent half of it on a new bike. Later that year I sold pop at home Missouri football games, and pop sold for 50 cents each or $12.50 a tray of 25 drinks, but we earned only 50 cents per tray. On a good day, I earned $15. I also sold programs and commission was 50%, but nobody bought any of them from me because I wore Nebraska's school colors of red and white (I was born in Lincoln, NE and was a Cornshuskers' fan, even though Missouri had excellent teams at the time)."

Worst day to work was Hog sale day on Wednesdays or Thursday's, as the Bull Pen was built on the front of the livestock sale barn. The smell was staggering... Outside, not inside the restaurant.
